# Module 8 Challenge: SurfsUp Analysis
Cowabunga dude! This is my repository for analyzing weather data in Hawaii


## Project Overview
In this module I conducted an analysis of weather data for a surf & ice cream shop called "Surf n' Shake". The purpose of this project is to run analytics on weather temperatures in June and December to determine whether Surf n' Shake will have good weather conditions to operate in Oahu.

For my analysis I used a variety of tools to perform advaned data storage and retrieval actions, including: 

 - Flask - a web framework that uses Python to build web pages 
 - SQLite -  a database engine embedded into the end program 
 - SQL Alchemy - a query tool for performing integration of statistical analysis with dataframe analysis


## Results
Below is a summary of June's tempature statistics

Below is a summary of December's temperature statistics

## Summary
In summary, the weather in December and June exhibit similar behavior - the high points in December are relatively close to the weather experienced in June but the low points are significantly lower in December. 

## Additional Queries 
One addition query I would run would include the difference in precipitation between June and December. I would be very interested to see how the precipitation highs and lows track against the highs and lows of rain, is there any difference? Could this help better determine when the Surf n' Shake shop should run? That analysis would provide a "tidal wave" of insights :)
