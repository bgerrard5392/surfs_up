# Module 8 Challenge: SurfsUp Analysis
cowabunga dude! This is my repository for analyzing weather data in Hawaii


## Project Overview
In this module I created a function to take in files from three different sources (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data) and performed an ETL process to create a data pipeline.




## Results
Below is a summary of June's tempature statistics


Below is a summaryt of December's temperature statistics






## Summary
In summary, the weather in December and June exhibit similar behavior - the high points in December are relatively close to the weather experienced in June but the low points are significantly lower in December.
